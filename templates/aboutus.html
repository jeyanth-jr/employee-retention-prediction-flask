            Welcome to the employee retention prediction site!
            Our goal is to help employers predict and prevent employee turnover by analyzing various factors that may contribute to an employee's likelihood of leaving the company.
            To use our site, simply enter in information about your employees such as their job title, length of time with the company, and performance ratings. Our algorithm will then analyze this information and provide a prediction on the likelihood of the employee leaving the company.
            In addition to providing a prediction, our site also offers suggestions on how to improve employee retention. This can include offering additional training or development opportunities, increasing compensation, or addressing any issues or concerns the employee may have.
            We understand that retaining top talent is critical to the success of any organization, and we hope that our site can be a valuable resource in helping you do just that. Thank you for using the employee retention prediction site!
